'''
Tempo: We can estimate possessions very well from box score stats by using this formula:
FGA-OR+TO+0.475xFTA.
For each team, possessions are counted for the team and their opponents, and then averaged.
A teamâ€™s average tempo is total possessions divided by minutes.

'''
The following description is for individual players.  We are creating a more
straight-forward formula for determining the number of steals a team has per
possessions it plays.

Basketball Reference: STL%
Steal Percentage (available since the 1973-74 season in the NBA); the formula is
100 * (STL * (Tm MP / 5)) / (MP * Opp Poss). Steal Percentage is an estimate of
the percentage of opponent possessions that end with a steal by the player while
he was on the floor.

Kenpom:
Steal Percentage (%Stls): This is the percentage of possessions that a player
records a steal shile he is on the court. It is computed by Steals/(%Min * Team
Possessions).
